2021-2022 Tipping Point!
This program is for the autonomous part of the tipping point competition. Instead of using drivetrain, this program controls the induvidual motors. This also includes being able to calibrate each variable like speed, drive distance, and turning. It includes an equation that converts distance to how many degrees the wheels should rotate, so that instead of inputting degrees, you can just input how far you want the robot to drive.
